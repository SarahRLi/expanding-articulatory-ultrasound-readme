# Expanding articulatory information interpreted from ultrasound imaging
Research projects from dissertation: http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=ucin1733841772461598

Code and data for the three projects are mostly available:
1. Speech therapy game using simplified ultrasound biofeedback
   - Please contact for a private link to the TonguePART GUI and Go Go Goat! game
2. Ultrasound image simulations to improve tongue shape interpretation
   - Code and data are available on OSF: https://osf.io/ntbhu
3. Multimodal neural networks for vocal tract shape prediction during ultrasound imaging
   - Code and data are available on OSF: https://osf.io/ah6fr
